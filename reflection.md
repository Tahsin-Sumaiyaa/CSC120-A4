Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.
The hardest assignement so far. But it helped me develope my java skills to a lot extent. Especially the way different objects belonging to different class merge altogether to create one single object is really fascinating. Using this methodology a lot of interesting things can be created in java. I'm excited to try such new things.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
It helped me keep things private so that others cannot modify values, like the name of the passengers, and at the sam time to use these methods smoothly by using getters.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Learn how to incorporate one class object into other class, so that you can create severale files for different class individually and run all these together in the main method of any particular class, or in a seperate main class.
